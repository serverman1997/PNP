          <hr>
          <p>
            The People’s National Party (PNP), founded by Jonathan La Crette on February 5th, 2025, presents a clear and purposeful vision for the future of Grenada. With white being the PNP's party color, integrated with the colors of the national flag and the Nutmeg symbol, the PNP brings a distinct quality of nationalism to the political landscape of Grenada.  By identifying as a center-right political organization rooted in Christian Democracy, Liberal Conservatism, and Conservatism, the PNP brings a unique set of ideological principles that will not only guide its policy decisions but also reflect the values of the people. 
             The PNP’s ideological pillars of Christian Democracy, Liberal Conservatism, and Conservatism anchors the party’s policy direction, focusing on key values that emphasize a balance of social responsibility, economic opportunity, and traditional principles.
               Christian Democracy provides a moral and ethical framework for governance that upholds human dignity, supports the vulnerable, and champions family values.
               Liberal Conservatism promotes free market principles, personal responsibility, and individual freedoms while seeking to maintain social order and moral responsibility while
Conservatism emphasizes the preservation of traditional values and institutions, such as community, family, and faith, while ensuring that societal changes are gradual and respectful of cultural heritage.
These combined pillars create a party focused on sustainable development, moral governance, and social harmony, seeking to advance policies that align with virtue, common good, and human dignity.

The PNP's Core Philosophical Pillars are centered on:
